# Bank Management System

### A simple bank management system (CLI Application)

* A project assigned for submission in the 5th Semester exam
* This CLI application has been entirely written in JAVA
* It can perform several tasks like:
  * Adding an account
  * Updating an account
  * Removing an account/database
  * Read the contents of an account
  * Print the entire accounts' statements into a csv file

### TODO:
* Create a UML diagram for the application
* Test all the functionalities of the application (also crush bugs if they appear)
* Any suggestions or PRs would be greatly appreciated
